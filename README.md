Hi, I got sick of being called a boomer so github is now my social media.

A list of some on-going projects I'm working on.
* [saving christmas (advent of code 2023)](https://gist.github.com/space-miner/1b4e0da29a424c74e3055872c9d289d3)
* [writing test harnesses and verifying rest of sean anderson's bit hacks](https://github.com/space-miner/bit-twiddling)
* working through [logical foundations](https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/lf-current/index.html) in the software foundations series
